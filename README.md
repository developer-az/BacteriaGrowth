This Java program calculates the growth of a bacteria culture over time based on user inputs. It also provides an option to calculate the time it will take for the culture to reach a certain number of bacteria. For example, if you input 2000 for the initial amount of bacteria, 60 for the doubling time, and 7000 for the target number of bacteria, the program will output the time it will take for the culture to reach 7000 bacteria.
